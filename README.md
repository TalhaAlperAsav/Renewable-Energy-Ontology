# Overview:
Renewable energy ontologyis a semantic web project focused on developing an ontology to model and organize knowledge related to green energy. The project aims to provide a structured representation of concepts, entities, and relationships within the domain, facilitating better understanding, sharing, and integration of information.

# Key Features: 
## Ontology Development:
The project involves the creation of an ontology using RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to define classes, properties, and relationships relevant to the domain. Created using Protégé.
## Semantic Web Technologies: 
Utilizes semantic web technologies to enhance the meaning and interoperability of data, enabling automated reasoning and advanced data integration.
## Data Integration: 
Enables the integration of heterogeneous data sources by providing a common framework for representing and linking data from various sources. I used Wikidata in this project.
## Displaying Results: 
We execute SPARQL queries against multiple endpoints and display the results in an HTML webpage. It utilizes Python Flask to send queries to SPARQL endpoints, fetches the results, and dynamically updates the HTML content to show the retrieved data.
